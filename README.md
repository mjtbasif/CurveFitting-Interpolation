# Linear Curve Fitting and Gauss Backward Interpolation

This is CSE225:Numerical Methods course project. The project is divided into two parts. First part is linear curve fitting and the second part is, Gauss backward interpolation.  In the linear curve fitting, we simply create an equation like, y=bx+a. To create this equation, we must calculate the value of a and for given values of N, X and Y. Here N stands for total values of X and Y stands for different values of F(X). After getting the values of a and b, we will find a linear equation. For different values of X, we will get different values for Y. From these values of X and Y, we will be able to calculate F(X) using Gauss Backward interpolation.
